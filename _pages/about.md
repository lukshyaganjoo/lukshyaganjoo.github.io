hello there! my name is lukshya. i'm a bs/ms student studying cs and math and a member of the [quantum group](https://quantum.cs.washington.edu/) at the university of washington. when i'm not obsessing over the next big thing in cs theory or trying to decipher an algebra proof, i spend a lot of my time writing and looking for novel ways to spruce up the humble bagel and toast. i particularly enjoy things in loose and broad association with quantum computing, learning theory, spectral graph theory and all things probability. 

if you're in the same city, looking to chat, or find yourself in need of a scrumptious banana bread recipe i'm always looking forward to making new friends :), feel free to reach out! additionally if any of the stuff i talked about is interesting to you, check out the [theory group](https://theory.cs.washington.edu/) at uw. might be biased but they're pretty cool as well.
