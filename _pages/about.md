hello there! my name is lukshya. i'm a first-year phd student at ucsd advised by [Daniel Grier](https://danielgrier.com/). in another life i studied cs and math at the university of washington where i had the good fortune of being advised by [Andrea Coladangelo](https://www.andreacoladangelo.com/), [Stefan Steinerberger](https://faculty.washington.edu/steinerb/) and [Chinmay Nirkhe](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nirkhe/).

i particularly enjoy things in loose and broad association with quantum algorithms, random matrix theory, learning theory, spectral graph theory and all things probability. also seemingly unrelated, but i think a lot about unitary designs.

when i'm not thinking about cs or math, i spend a lot of my time playing [botc](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/) with friends, [writing](https://ganjoo.substack.com/) and looking for novel ways to spruce up the humble bagel and toast. if you're in the same city, looking to chat, or find yourself in need of a scrumptious banana bread recipe i'm always looking forward to making new friends :), feel free to reach out!
