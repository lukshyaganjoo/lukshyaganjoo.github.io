hello there! my name is lukshya ganjoo, and i'm a junior at the university of washington, seattle, majoring in computer science and mathematics. when i'm not obsessing over the next big thing in cs theory or trying to decipher an algebra proof, i spend a lot of my time writing and looking for novel ways to spruce up the humble bagel and toast.

while the coolness factor of math is unstated and undeniable, i particularly enjoy things in loose and broad association with quantum computing, graph theory and all things probability. not trying to be a propagandist, but i think algebra is one of the prettiest fields of math, and everyone should take a course in it at some point in their lives. some folks are really missing out.

i am presently under the guidance of professor sara mouradian and vikram kashyap, where i'm focused on gate-based quantum computation utilizing qudit gates. in broad strokes, i study qudit-gate fidelity, gate decomposition, and the experimental advantages in the context of an enlarged basis. in the same vein, i've also ta'ed for a graduate course on quantum computing, taught by andrea coladangelo. from the algebraic perspective, i'm currently reading commutative algebra by Reid along with Brian Nugent. Reid's book is particularly nice because it focuses on commutative algebra with several connections to algebraic geometry.

if you're in the same city, looking to chat, or find yourself in need of a scrumptious banana bread recipe i'm always looking forward to making new friends :). i can be reached out to on [email](mailto: lukshyaganjoo@cs.washington.edu),
