hello there! my name is lukshya. i'm an incoming phd student at ucsd advied by [Daniel Grier](https://danielgrier.com/). in another life i studied cs and math at the university of washington where i had the good fortune of being advided by [Andrea Coladangelo](https://www.andreacoladangelo.com/) and [Chinmay Nirkhe](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nirkhe/).

i particularly enjoy things in loose and broad association with quantum algorithms, random matrix theory, learning theory, spectral graph theory and all things probability. also seemingly unrelated, but i think a lot about unitary designs.

when i'm not obsessing over the next big thing in cs theory or trying to decipher an algebra proof, i spend a lot of my time writing and looking for novel ways to spruce up the humble bagel and toast. if you're in the same city, looking to chat, or find yourself in need of a scrumptious banana bread recipe i'm always looking forward to making new friends :), feel free to reach out!
