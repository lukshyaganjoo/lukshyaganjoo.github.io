hello there! my name is lukshya. i'm a bs/ms student studying cs and math and a member of the [quantum group](https://quantum.cs.washington.edu/) at the university of washington. when i'm not obsessing over the next big thing in cs theory or trying to decipher an algebra proof, i spend a lot of my time writing and looking for novel ways to spruce up the humble bagel and toast.

while the coolness factor of math is unstated and undeniable, i particularly enjoy things in loose and broad association with quantum computing, learning theory, spectral graph theory and all things probability. not trying to be a propagandist, but i think algebra is one of the prettiest fields of math, and everyone should take a course in it at some point in their lives. some folks are really missing out.

if you're in the same city, looking to chat, or find yourself in need of a scrumptious banana bread recipe i'm always looking forward to making new friends :). feel free to reach out!
