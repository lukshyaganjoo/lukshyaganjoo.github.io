hello there! my name is lukshya. i'm a first-year phd student at ucsd advised by [Daniel Grier](https://danielgrier.com/). in another life i studied cs and math at the university of washington.

i particularly enjoy things in loose and broad association with quantum algorithms, learning theory and property testing. also seemingly unrelated, but i think a lot about unitary designs.

when i'm not thinking about cs or math, i spend a lot of my time playing [botc](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/) with friends, [writing](https://ganjoo.substack.com/) and reading [the new yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/). if you're in the same city, looking to chat, or find yourself in need of a new garlic bread recipe, i'm always looking forward to making new <br> friends :) feel free to reach out!
