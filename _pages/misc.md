## teaching

i've been a teaching assistant for the cs department at uw since the summer right after freshman year. if you're at uw and are considering applying to teach for a class you took at some point; i highly recommend it; definitely one of the most formative experiences i've had in college. below is a possibly outdated list of courses i've ta'ed for
