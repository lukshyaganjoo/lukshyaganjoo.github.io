## teaching

i've been a teaching assistant for the cs department at uw since the summer right after freshman year. if you're at uw and are considering applying to teach for a class you took at some point; i highly recommend it; definitely one of the most formative experiences i've had in college. below is a possibly outdated list of courses i've ta'ed for

<ul class="list-group list-group-flush">

<!-- ## reading and research

- i'm currently working with [Andrea Coladangelo](https://www.andreacoladangelo.com/) and [Chinmay Nirkhe](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~nirkhe/) on the $$\textsf{QMC}$$ problem where we're trying to develop better approximation algorithms to find a high energy state for a class of $$k$$-local hamiltonians that while physically motivated, also serve as a generalization for the [max-cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) problem.

- this spring, i worked within [WXML](https://wxml.math.washington.edu/) on a project with [Stefan Steinerberger](https://math.washington.edu/people/stefan-steinerberger) alongside some other students on the **Bad Science Matrix problem** which consisted in finding, among all $$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$, with rows having unit $$\ell^2$$ norm, the one that maximized

  \begin{align*}

  \end{align*}

- in a past life, i worked with **Sara Mouradian** and [Vikram Kashyap](https://vikramkashyap.com/) on understanding systems of qu$$d$$its and how they affected fidelity estimates and error rates in experiment. this project investigated error correction codes, developing a notion of universality for qu$$d$$it systems and how different architectures could be used to improve the fidelity of quantum computations. some relevant links for the same

- i also participated in the [directed reading program](https://sites.uw.edu/wdrp/) the math department @ uw runs. alongside Brian Nugent, we read up on a different perspective on teaching commutative algebra, see: [Miles Reid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Reid), one that was more focused on the geometric aspects of the subject. as a consequence i got to see a lot of beautiful results from algebraic geometry i wouldn't have otherwise seen.

## lecture notes 
as u can already tell; i'm a huge fan of writing. also a big $$\latex$$ person; whatever that may entail. here are some lecture notes i've written; many of which are still works in progress.
