Blazes of glory at midnight  
Flicker ever so slightly in misfit murkiness  
A gilded cage, his own creation  
The deleterious flames; a gratifying nectar

The traveller gripped his lantern by his breast  
Sputters of blood dripped from his chafed lips  
Respiratory constitution, all for momentary warmth  
Mystifying effects, that of which he was aware

He stopped, a moment of rest  
Besides him, the lantern grew a bloodshot orange  
He stole a glance at the shattered glass; a horrible transfiguration  
The serenity of rationalism and courage  
Overpowered urges, forged in heresy

Lanterns were known for their lead traced fumes  
A cautionary tale; appreciable distance, quite the necessity

A quick dust off the cloak  
He tossed aside the wavering blemish  
The cold took over his limbs; rendered his journey impossible  
He much preferred the continual frost, than cruel moments of comfort  
An iron-willed being, he found the lock  
Weary, fatigued; yet finally free

Untethered strings, now free of knots  
To be or not to be healed, can they ever?

~Lukshya
