## introduction

It seems there’s been a paradigm shift in the way popular media talks about quantum computing. Initially pessimistic, even revolutionary tech figures like [Jensen Huang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang) have turned heel on what they now believe to be the viability of large-scale quantum computers in the near future. Yet today there are several compelling reasons to take quantum seriously; the “elevator pitch” is not exclusively an appeal to authority. I won’t dive into those reasons here, but if you’re curious why I think this is such an exciting area of computer science, feel free to email me and I’d be happy to explain in detail.

For those already interested in quantum, demonstrating quantum advantage remains paramount. After all, quantum computing was originally sold as a model that could deliver dramatically faster speed‑ups across a wide class of problems. In some cases, these speed‑ups are exponential: for example, John Watrous’s excellent video on quantum‑query algorithms in IBM’s “Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms” series. However, many of these algorithms feel somewhat artificially constructed to highlight extreme cases. Today, we’ll discuss an algorithm whose speed‑up is more modest in scale but applies to a much broader class of problems.

## the problem itself

> Given black-box access to a function $$f : \{0, 1\}^n
> \to \{0, 1\} $$, output a **marked input** $$\mathbf {x}^*$$
> such that $$f(\mathbf{x}^*) = 1$$, if one exists.

here, black-box access means that we can only interact with the function $$f$$ via querying $$f$$ on bit-strings in $$\{0, 1\}^n$$. we do not have access to any algorithm or circuit that can compute said function.

## a classical lower bound

the best known classical algorithm for this setting of problem is unfortunately no better than brute-force. given that there are $$2^n$$ $$n$$-bit binary strings, this provides a run-time of $$\Omega(2^n)$$.

## querying a function quantumly

operations in the quantum world are mostly[^1] governed by [unitary transformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_transformation) and [measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_in_quantum_mechanics). querying a function $f$ quantumly is specified as follows

<p style = "overflow-x:auto">
$$
\begin{align*}
    \ket{x} \ket{y} &\substack{\mathbf{U}_f \\ \mapsto} \ket{x} \ket{y \oplus f(x)}
\end{align*}
$$
</p> where $$\mathbf{U}_f$$ is the corresponding unitary that implements the function $$f$$ and $$x, y \in \{0, 1\}^n$$.

## the phase oracle

given a function $$f$$, it turns out assuming oracle access to $$\mathbf{U}_f$$ as prescribed above is equivalent to **querying the function in phase**. what i mean by this is having access to a unitary $$\mathbf{O}_f$$ such that

<p style = "overflow-x:auto">
$$\begin{align*}
\ket{x} &\substack{\mathbf{O}_f \\ \mapsto} (-1)^{f(x)} \ket{x}
\end{align*}$$
</p>

**proof** this turns out to use a trick that shows up quite often in the field; namely querying the unitary in superposition. we have that

<p style = "overflow-x:auto">
$$\begin{align*}
\mathbf{U}_f \ket{x} \ket{-} &= \mathbf{U}_f \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\ket{0} - \ket{1}\right)\right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{U}_f \ket{x}\ket{0} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mathbf{U}_f \ket{x} \ket{1} \\
&= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{x}\ket{f(x)} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{x} \ket{1 \oplus f(x)} \\
&= \ket{x} \otimes \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{f(x)} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \ket{1 \oplus f(x)}\right) = (-1)^{f(x)} \ket{x} \ket{-}
\end{align*}$$ 
</p>
where we made use of the definition and linearity of $$\mathbf{U}_f$$, thereby settling the claim.

## grover's insight
[grover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lov_Grover) proposed the following circuit to solve the problem
