# shadows
A crippling fear of what lies beyond  
Prevalence in terror and knowledge   
Yet, a complete lack of direction on the subsequent step   
Unexpected, yet moulded in a surprising rigidity   

Several, fall victim rather recurringly   
I must speak my mind before it claims my soul   
A herculean task, yet my duty as a human being   
All attempts, bound to result in failure   
Redefining “helplessness” to something unknown   

A bead of sweat blurs the nib   
An unusual shine to scrawled words on the paper   
Words rendered illegible, yet a resounding growl   
The cursive, stops mid-way, akin to a paralysed corpse   

Strange, perhaps due to newfangled disposition   
Or just a naivety to unconnected circumstances   
I welcome the unpredictable, a strange balm   
Yet, there's something unsettling  
Despite a near-needled narcissism   
I must question this dissonance in opinion   

Silly me, I seem to have dropped something  
Perchance, a mere triviality; just the ramblings of a madman  

~Lukshya
