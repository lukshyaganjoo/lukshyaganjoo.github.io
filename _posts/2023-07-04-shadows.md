A crippling fear of what lies beyond  
Prevalence in terror and knowledge  
Yet, a complete lack of direction on the subsequent step  
Unexpected, yet moulded in a surprising rigidity

Several, fall victim rather recurringly  
I must speak my mind before it claims my soul  
A herculean task, yet my duty as a human being  
All attempts, bound to result in failure  
Redefining “helplessness” to something unknown

A bead of sweat blurs the nib  
An unusual shine to scrawled words on the paper  
Words rendered illegible, yet a resounding growl  
The cursive, stops mid-way, akin to a paralysed corpse

Strange, perhaps due to newfangled disposition  
Or just a naivety to unconnected circumstances  
I welcome the unpredictable, a strange balm  
Yet, there's something unsettling  
Despite a near-needled narcissism  
I must question this dissonance in opinion

Silly me, I seem to have dropped something  
Perchance, a mere triviality; just the ramblings of a madman

~Lukshya
