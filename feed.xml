Initially pessimistic, even revolutionary tech figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang">Jensen Huang</a> have turned heel on what they now believe to be the viability of large-scale quantum computers in the near future. Yet today there are several compelling reasons to take quantum seriously; the “elevator pitch” is not exclusively an appeal to authority. I won’t dive into those reasons here, but if you’re curious why I think this is such an exciting area of computer science, feel free to email me and I’d be happy to explain in detail.</p> <p>For those already interested in quantum, demonstrating quantum advantage remains paramount. After all, quantum computing was originally sold as a model that could deliver dramatically faster speed‑ups across a wide class of problems. In some cases, these speed‑ups are exponential: for example, John Watrous’s excellent video on quantum‑query algorithms in IBM’s “Fundamentals of Quantum Algorithms” series. However, many of these algorithms feel somewhat artificially constructed to highlight extreme cases. Today, we’ll discuss an algorithm whose speed‑up is more modest in scale but applies to a much broader class of problems.</p> <h2 id="the-problem-itself">the problem itself</h2> <blockquote> <p>Given black-box access to a function \(f : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}\), output a <strong>marked input</strong> \(\mathbf {x}^*\) such that \(f(\mathbf{x}^*) = 1\), if one exists.</p> </blockquote> <p>here, black-box access means that we can only interact with the function \(f\) via querying \(f\) on bit-strings in \(\{0, 1\}^n\). we do not have access to any algorithm or circuit that can compute said function.

Let us assume for simplicity, that there is a single marked input \(\mathbf{x^*} \in \{0, 1\}^n\). We start with \(\ket{0}^{n}\) and prepare a uniform superposition by applying \(\mathbf{H}^{\otimes n}\);</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \ket{0}^n &amp;\substack{\mathbf{H}^{\otimes n} \\ \mapsto} \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} := \ket{\psi} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>For the sake of notational convenience, we will write the state \(\ket{\psi}\) in terms of the marked input and the rest of the \(n\)-bit strings. This provides</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \ket{\psi} &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \ket{x^*} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{x \neq x^*} \ket{x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \ket{G} + \sqrt{\frac{N - 1}{N}} \ket{B} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>where \(\ket{G} := \ket{x^*}\) is the “good part” of the superposition and \(\ket{B} := \frac{1}{\sqrt{N - 1}} \sum \limits_{x \neq x^*} \ket{x}\) is the “bad part” of the superposition; the part of the input that we don’t care about. Note that the normalization here is just so that \(\ket{G}\) and \(\ket{B}\) are valid quantum states.</p> <p>Now given that this is a quantum algorithm, we have to make some kind of measurement towards the end. Were we to measure now, we would get the marked input \(\mathbf{x}^*\) with very low probability, precisely \(\frac{1}{N}\). At a high-level, our hope is to somehow “amplify” the amplitude of this coefficient so as to ensure we get the marked input string with very high probability when we measure. This is exactly what the <strong>Grover iterates</strong> or the repeated application of \(\mathbf{O_f} \mathbf{R}\) achieves for us.</p> <p>Before we dive into what the Grover iterate does for us, let us first massage our state into a more convenient expression.

Note that it is not important to understand deeply the definition of a hash function, rather simply that with the appropriate independence assumptions, it essentially behaves like a uniform random variable.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="a-surprisingly-simple-solution">a surprisingly simple solution</h2> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{array}{l} \textbf{function} \; \texttt{estimateDistinct}(\text{stream}, k): \\ \quad \text{initialize } k \text{ independent hash functions } h_1, h_2, \dots, h_k : \{0, \dots, n - 1\} \to [0, 1] \\ \quad \texttt{val}_1 \leftarrow \infty, \texttt{ val}_2 \leftarrow \infty, \dots, \texttt{ val}_k \leftarrow \infty \\ \quad \text{for } i = 1 \text{ to } n: \\ \quad \quad x \leftarrow \texttt{stream}[i] \\ \quad \quad \text{for } j = 1 \text{ to } k: \\ \quad \quad \quad \texttt{val}_j \leftarrow \min\{\texttt{val}_j, h_j(x)\} \\ \quad Z \leftarrow \frac{1}{k} \sum \limits_{i = 1}^k \texttt{val}_i \\ \quad \text{return } \bigg\lfloor \frac{1}{Z} - 1 \bigg\rfloor \\ \end{array} $$ </p> <p>what the above algorithm is essentially doing is hashing each element in the stream \(k\) times and keeping track of the minimum hash value for each element. it is then taking the average of these minimum hash values and returning the appropriate estimate on the last line of the algorithm.</p> <h2 id="why-is-an-average-of-minimums-necessary">why is an average of minimums necessary?</h2> <p>in order to answer this question, we consider the following modification to the algorithm. \(\begin{array}{l} \textbf{function } \texttt{incorrectEstimateDistinct(stream, k)} \\ \quad \text{initialize a hash function } h : \{0, \dots, n - 1\} \to [0, 1] \\ \quad \texttt{val} \gets \infty \\ \quad \textbf{for } i = 1 \textbf{ to } n: \\ \quad\quad x \gets \texttt{stream}[i] \\ \quad\quad \texttt{val}_i \gets \min(\texttt{val}_i, h(x)) \\ \quad Z \gets \min_{i \in [k]} \texttt{val}_i \\ \quad \textbf{return } \left\lfloor \frac{1}{Z} - 1 \right\rfloor \end{array}\)</p> <p>while the above algorithm is not sufficient for our purposes, it does produces the correct solution on average!

The issue is that the variance of the estimator is too high.

Following this reasoning, the graph is a union of disjoint cycles, and it is equivalent to say that the graph is connected if and only if there exists a <strong>Hamiltonian cycle</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>definition</strong></p> <p>a <strong>cycle</strong> in a graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is a sequence of vertices \(v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_k\) such that \((v_i, v_{i+1}) \in E\) for all \(i = 1, 2, \ldots, k - 1\) and \((v_k, v_1) \in E\). a cycle is said to be <strong>Hamiltonian</strong> if it visits every vertex exactly once.</p> </blockquote> <p>We now fix the first perfect matching. We proceed by computing the probability that the second perfect matching does not close a shorter cycle. We start with the first vertex \(v_1\) and the endpoint of the first edge \((v_1, u_1)\). \(u_1\) must be connected to some other vertex \(v_2\) in the second perfect matching, in order to not close a cycle, let’s call this vertex \(v_2\). Since there are \(n\) vertices, there are \(n - 2\) ways to construct an edge from \(v_2\) to another vertex. Therefore the probability is given by \((n - 2)/(n - 1)\) (since we don’t consider self-loops) Now \(v_2\) is part of some other edge \((v_2, u_2)\). \(u_2\) must be connected to some other vertex \(v_3\), and not any of the previous vertices. This gives us \((n - 4)/(n - 3)\) choices where the denominator is \(n - 3\) since we don’t consider edges going from \(u_2\) to itself, \(v_1\), or \(v_2\). We continue this process until we reach the last vertex \(v_{n - 1}\), giving us</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \Pr[\mathcal{G}_k \text{ is connected}] = \frac{n - 2}{n - 1} \cdot \frac{n - 4}{n - 3} \cdots \frac{2}{1} = \frac{(n - 2)!!}{(n - 1)!!} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>Since \(n = 2t\) (there are an even number of vertices in a perfect matching), we have</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \frac{(n - 2)!!}{(n - 1)!!} &amp;= \frac{(2t - 2)!!}{(2t - 1)!!} = \frac{(2t - 2) \cdot (2t - 4) \cdots 2}{(2t - 1) \cdot (2t - 3) \cdots 1} \\ &amp;= \frac{2^{t - 1} (2t)!! (t - 1)!}{(2t)!} = 2^{2t - 1} \cdot \frac{(t - 1)!}{(2t)!} \cdot k! \\ &amp;\approx 2^{2t - 1} \cdot \frac{\left(\frac{t - 1}{e}\right)^{t - 1}}{\left(\frac{2t}{e}\right)^{2t}} \cdot \frac{t^{t}}{e^{t}} = \frac{e}{2} \cdot \frac{(t - 1)^{t - 1}}{t^{2t}} \cdot t^{t} = \frac{e}{2} \cdot \frac{(t - 1)^{t - 1}}{t^t} \\ &amp;= \frac{e}{2} \cdot \frac{\left(1 - \frac{1}{t}\right)^{t - 1}}{t} \approx e \cdot \frac{e^{-1/t (t - 1)}}{2k} = e \cdot \frac{e^{1/t - 1}}{2t} \\ &amp;= e/n \cdot e^{1/t - 1} = e^{1/t} / n \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>where all the approximations were via Stirlings and we made use of the fact that \(n = 2t\). The desired result follows by noting that \(\lim \limits_{n \to \infty} \frac{e^{1/t}}{n} = 0\).</p> <h3 id="the-main-result">the main result</h3> <p>now that we have established the necessity of the condition \(k \geq 3\), we can proceed with the main result. specifically we show that the claim is true for \(k = 3\) and our method immediately generalizes to any \(k &gt; 3\).</p> <p>Observe that a graph is said to be connected if and only if every cut contains an edge. We define \(\mathcal{G}_k = (V, E)\) to be a multi-graph with \(2n\) vertices (since perfect matchings only exist on graphs with an even number of vertices). Let \(\Omega\) be the set of all possible cuts in \(\mathcal{G}_k\). We then have</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \Pr\bigg[\mathcal{G}_k \text{ is connected}\bigg] &amp;= \Pr\bigg[\bigcap_{\omega \in \Omega} \omega \text{ contains an edge}\bigg] \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>We want to show that this probability approaches 1 for \(n \to \infty\). Note that this is equivalent to saying</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \Pr\bigg[G_k \text{ is disconnected}\bigg] \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty $$ </p> <p>Now using De Morgan’s Law and simplifying slightly, we have</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \Pr\bigg[\mathcal{G}_k \text{ is disconnected}\bigg] &amp;= \Pr\bigg[\left(\bigcap_{\omega \in \Omega} \omega \text{ contains an edge}\right)^c\bigg] \\ &amp;= \Pr\bigg[\bigcup_{\omega \in \Omega} \omega \text{ contains no edges}\bigg] \\ &amp;\leq \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \Pr\bigg[\omega \text{ contains no edges}\bigg] &amp;&amp; \text{Union Bound} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>We are now interested in the probability that a cut doesn’t have an edge. Therefore we fix some cut \(C = (S, V \setminus S)\) such that \(\lvert S \rvert = l\) and \(\lvert V \setminus S \rvert = 2n - l\). We’re interested in computing the probability that there is no edge between \(S\) and \(V \setminus S\), i.e. \(\Pr[\lvert E(S, V \setminus S) \rvert = 0]\). We make the observation that if \(\lvert E(S, V \setminus S) \rvert = 0\), then the perfect matchings restricted to \(S\) are also a perfect matching. Note that since we have perfect matchings, any cut of odd size is assured to have size greater than zero. Thus, it suffices to consider the cases where the cut \(C\) divides graph into a subsets of size \(2i, 2n - 2i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n - 1\), allowing us to conclude that \(l = 2i\). Note that the number of perfect matchings on \(2i\) vertices is given by</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \# \text{ of perfect matchings on } 2i \text{ vertices} = \frac{(2i)!}{2^i i!} = (2i - 1)!! $$ </p> <p>where \(!!\) indicates the double factorial. This number can be found via picking a vertex \(v_1\), noting that there are \(2i - 1\) choices for the vertex \(v_2\) as its endpoint (since it cannot be itself), then find another vertex \(v_3\), observing that it has \(2i - 3\) vertices to choose from (cannot be any of the previous 2 or itself) and so on. Therefore, all this implies that finding the number of perfect matchings on \(n\) vertices with no edges is equivalent to finding a perfect matching on \(S\) and a perfect matching on \(V \setminus S\) where \(\lvert S \rvert = 2i, \lvert V \setminus S \rvert = 2n - 2i\).</p> <p>We partition over the size of all possible cuts. Considering the cuts of size \(2i\) and \(2n - 2i\) where \(i \in \{1, \dots, n - 1\}\) and then noting that for a single perfect matching, the probability that a cut of size \(2i\) doesn’t have an edge is given by</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \Pr[\text{cut of size } 2i \text{ has no edges for a perfect matching}] = \frac{\frac{(2i)!}{2^i i!} \cdot \frac{(2n - 2i)!}{2^{n - i} (n - i)!}}{\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}} $$ </p> <p>The probability that all 3 perfect matchings have no edges crossing this cut is given by</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \Pr[\text{cut of size } 2i \text{ has no edges for 3 perfect matchings}] = \left(\frac{\frac{(2i)!}{2^i i!} \cdot \frac{(2n - 2i)!}{2^{n - i} (n - i)!}}{\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}}\right)^3 $$ </p> <p>since the matchings are drawn uniformly at random. We also note that there are \(\binom{2n}{2i}\) ways to choose the vertices for the cut. Therefore the algebra in the sum we had earlier gives us</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \Pr\bigg[G_k \text{ is disconnected}\bigg] &amp;\leq \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \Pr[\text{cut of size } 2i \text{ has no edges}] \\ &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \binom{2n}{2i} \cdot \left(\frac{\frac{(2i)!}{2^i i!} \cdot \frac{(2n - 2i)!}{2^{n - i} (n - i)!}}{\frac{(2n)!}{2^n n!}}\right)^3 \\ &amp;\approx \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{\left(\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n \cdot \left(\frac{e}{i}\right)^i \cdot \left(\frac{e}{n - i}\right)^{n - i}\right)^3}{\left(\left(\frac{2n}{e}\right)^{2n} \cdot \left(\frac{e}{2i}\right)^{2i} \cdot \left(\frac{e}{2n - 2i}\right)^{2n - 2i}\right)^2} \\ &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{n^{3n}}{i^{3i} (n - i)^{3(n - i)}} \cdot \frac{i^{4i} (n - i)^{4(n - i)}}{n^{4n}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{i^i (n - i)^{n - i}}{n^n} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>where we have once again made use of Striling’s approximation. Note that this is slightly overcounting (by a factor of 2 in fact) since for a cut of size \(2k\), and the complementary cut of size \(2n - 2k\), we count this cut \((S, V \setminus S)\) twice once for the \(i = k\) case and another time for the \(i = n - k\). However, this only changes a factor of 2 and asymptotically derives the same result, so we push through unfazed.</p> <p>We now turn our attention to bounding the following sum, for \(u = 3\).</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \Pr[G_k \text{ is disconnected}] \leq \frac{1}{n^{n}} \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i^{i} (n - i)^{n - 1} $$ </p> <p>Therefore, the expression of interest has now become</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \Pr\bigg[G_k \text{ is disconnected}\bigg] &amp;\leq \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} \frac{i^i (n - i)^{n - i}}{n^n} = \frac{1}{n^n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i^i (n - i)^{n - i} \\ &amp;\approx \frac{2}{n^n} \left(\sum_{i = 1}^{n/2} i^i (n - i)^{n - i} \right) \\ &amp;= \frac{2}{n^n} \left((n - 1)^{n - 1} + \sum_{i = 2}^{n/2} i^i (n - i)^{n - i} \right) \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>Now, getting slightly more formal with things. We define \(f : [2, n/2] \to \mathbb{R}\) where \(f(x) = x^x (n - x)^{n - x}\). Since \(f\) is continuous, we also have that \(f\) is bounded which is quite nice! Taking logs on both sides gives us</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} f(x) &amp;= x^x (n - x)^{n - x} \\ \log f(x) &amp;= \log \bigg(x^x (n - x)^{n - x}\bigg) \\ &amp;= \log \bigg(x^x\bigg) + \log \bigg((n - x)^{n - x}\bigg) \\ \log f(x) &amp;= x \log x + (n - x) \log (n - x) \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>We now argue that the function is decreasing, i.e. \(f'(x) &lt; 0\). We have</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} f'(x) / f(x) &amp;= \frac{d}{dx} \left(\left(x \log x\right) + (n - x) \log (n - x)\right) \\ &amp;= \frac{d}{dx} \left(x \log x\right) + \frac{d}{dx} \left((n - x) \log (n - x)\right) \\ &amp;= 1 + \log x - \log (n - x) - 1 = \log x - \log (n - x) \\ &amp;= \log \left(\frac{x}{n - x}\right) &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; \text{since } x &lt; n - x \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>where the last inequality follows from the fact that \(x \leq n/2\), and so we have \(\frac{x}{n - x} &lt; 1\) and therefore \(\log \left(\frac{x}{n - x}\right) &lt; 0\).</p> <p>Therefore the maximum of \(f\) for \(2 \leq x \leq n/2\) is attained at \(x = 2\), which gives us the very useful fact that for all \(x \in [2, n/2]\), \(f(x) \leq f(2)\), i.e.</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ f(x) \leq 2^2 (n - 2)^{n - 2} = 4 (n - 2)^{n - 2} $$ </p> <p>Putting all these facts together, we have</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \Pr\bigg[G_k \text{ is disconnected}\bigg] &amp;\leq \frac{2}{n^n} \left((n - 1)^{n - 1} + \sum_{i = 2}^{n/2} i^i (n - i)^{n - i} \right) \\ &amp;\leq \frac{2}{n^n} \left((n - 1)^{n - 1} + \sum_{i = 2}^{n/2} 4 (n - 2)^{n - 2} \right) \\ &amp;\leq \frac{2}{n^n} \left((n - 1)^{n - 1} + 4 (n - 2)^{n - 2} \cdot \frac{n}{2} \right) \\ &amp;= \frac{2 (n - 1)^{n - 1}}{n^n} + \frac{4 (n - 2)^{n - 2}}{n^{n - 1}} \\ &amp;= \frac{2 \left(\frac{n - 1}{n}\right)^{n - 1}}{n} + \frac{4 \left(\frac{n - 2}{n}\right)^{n - 2}}{n} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>Taking limits, we get</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{2 \left(\frac{n - 1}{n}\right)^{n - 1}}{n} + \frac{4 \left(\frac{n - 2}{n}\right)^{n - 2}}{n} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\frac{2}{en} + \frac{4}{e^2 n}\right) = 0 \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>which finally implies</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \Pr\bigg[\mathcal{G}_k \text{ is disconnected}\bigg] \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty \Longleftrightarrow \Pr\bigg[\mathcal{G}_k \text{ is connected}\bigg] \to 1 \text{ as } n \to \infty $$ </p> <p>and we are finally done.

Veteran graph theoreticians will be familiar with this pentagram inscribed within the spokes of a regular pentagon. The Petersen graph is used as a counter example in tons of graph theory proofs which is one of the reasons it’s so well studied, partly what we’ll be doing here. The Petersen graph has \(10\) nodes and \(15\) edges, and is what we call \(3\)-regular.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> A graph is said to be \(d\)-regular iff every vertex has the same degree \(d\). (i.e. it is strongly regular)</p> <p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/assets/img/full.png" alt="complete graph" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"/> </p> <p>This is the complete graph on \(10\) vertices. For the sake of convenience, we will refer to this graph as \(K_{10}\). It has \(10\) nodes and \(45\) edges (i.e., all possible edges among \(10\) nodes). If we follow along from the same scheme of defining things, the number of edges in \(K_{n}\) (the complete graph with \(n\) vertices) is given by \(\binom{n}{2}\).</p> <p>In this proof, \(\mathbf{J}_{n}\) refers to the all ones matrix with dimension/size \(n \times n\).</p> <p>The row space of a matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is defined as follows, \(\text{Row}(A) = \\{\mathbf{y}^{\mathbf{\top}} A : \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\\}\)</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>definition</strong></p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \textsf{Trace}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum \limits_{x \in E_{x}(\mathbf{A})} \lambda_{x} $$ </p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 1</strong></p> <p>For a symmetric matrix \(\mathbf{A}\), eigenvectors corresponding to <em>distinct</em> eigenvalues are orthogonal</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong><br/> Let \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\) be eigenvectors of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) corresponding to eigenvalues \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\) respectively. Therefore we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{y}^{\top} \mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{y}^{\top} \lambda_1 \mathbf{x} &amp;\implies \mathbf{y}^{\top} \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}^{\top} \lambda_1 \mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\implies \mathbf{(Ay)}^{\top} \mathbf{x} = \lambda_1 \mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\implies (\lambda_2 \mathbf{y})^\top \mathbf{x} = \lambda_2 \mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\implies \mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} (\lambda_2 - \lambda_1) = 0 \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>However, we already know that \(\lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1\). Therefore \(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1 \neq 0\), and it must be the case that \(\mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} = 0\).</p> <p>Therefore \(x\) and \(y\) are orthogonal.</p> <p><strong>adjacency matrices:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>definition</strong></p> <p>We define the adjacency matrix of a graph \(G = (V, E)\) as the following,</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ A_{ij} = \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{there is an edge from} \; j \; \text{to} \; i\\0 &amp; \text{there is no edge from} \; j \; \text{to} \; i\\ \end{cases} $$ </p> </blockquote> <p>Since we’re dealing with an undirected graph in this proof, every edge \((a, b)\) is counted as the same edge as if there were an edge \((b, a)\) in the graph. As a consequence, the adjacency matrices for this family of graphs will be symmetric.</p> <p>The way to think about it is that the adjacency matrix of a graph \(G\) encodes information about the number of length \(1\) paths between any pair of vertices \(i\) and \(j\), i.e. information about the vertices immediately “adjacent” to each other.</p> <h3 id="motivation">motivation:</h3> <p>Each node in \(K_{10}\) has \(9\) edges incident to it while each node in the Petersen graph has \(3\) edges incident to it. So it is plausible that \(K_{10}\) can be covered perfectly by \(3\) Petersen graphs. This means that you can lay down three Petersens on \(K_{10}\) so that vertices go to vertices and each edge of \(K_{10}\) lies under an edge of exactly one of the three Petersens. This hints at some pretty cutting-edge stuff in the field of graph decomposition and graph coloring and the parallels in higher dimensions is absolutely incredible. With some linear algebra at our disposal, we will show that it is not possible to completely cover \(K_{10}\) with three Petersen graphs.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="eigenvalues-of-the-petersen-graph">eigenvalues of the petersen graph</h2> <p>Finding the eigenvalues of any matrix, let alone one that of size \(10 \times 10\) is a fairly computational task and isn’t enlightening in any form whatsoever. So why are we trying to find the eigenvalues of the petersen graph? Well we can take advantage of the fact that the adjacency matrix represents information that carries physical meaning (vertex-edge relations of a graph) and can use the language of linear transformations and some geometric intuition to gain insight into the eigenvalues of this graph.</p> <p>Let \(\mathbf{A}\) be the adjacency matrix of the Petersen Graph. If \(\mathbf{A}\) encodes information about the number of length \(1\), \(\mathbf{A}^2\) represents information about the number of length \(2\) paths, and in general, \(A^k\) encodes information about the number of \(k\)-length paths in a given graph. With this information in our belt, we know can make a pretty nifty observation.</p> <p>Consider the \(i, j^{th}\) entry of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A}\) (the sum of the matrices representing information about the number of length \(2\) paths and the regular adjacency matrix of the petersen graph). Since, every vertex in the petersen graph has degree \(3\), each vertex has \(3\) length \(2\) paths back itself whereas there are no length \(1\) paths from a vertex to itself. With this information under our belt, we can say that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ (A^2 + A)_{ij} = \begin{cases} 3 &amp; \forall i = j \\ 1 &amp; \forall i \neq j \end{cases} $$ </p> <p>This follows from noticing that any pair of vertices not already joined by an edge are joined by a unique path of length \(2\); namely there is a unique vertex which is joined to both.</p> <p>We can therefore conclude that the matrix \(\mathbf{}\) satisfies the matrix equation \(\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} = 2\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J}\)</p> <p>Note that \(\mathbf{J}\) has eigenvalue 10 (of multiplicity 1 with eigenvector 1) and eigenvalue 0 of multiplicity 9. Thus \(2\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J}\) has eigenvalue 12 of multiplicity 1 and eigenvalue 2 of multiplicity 9. Now if \(x\) is an eigenvector of A of eigenvalue \(\lambda\) then \(\mathbf{x}\) is an eigenvector of \(\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A}\) of eigenvalue \(\lambda^2 + \lambda\).</p> <p>Thus the possible eigenvectors for \(\mathbf{A}\) are prescribed. We already know that \(\mathbf{1}\) is an eigenvector of \(\mathbf{A}\) of eigenvalue 3 (or at least it is easy to check). The other 9 eigenvalues must satisfy \(\lambda^2 + \lambda = 2\) thus either 1 or -2 with total multiplicity being 9. Now the trace of \(\mathbf{A}\), which is 0, is the sum of the eigenvalues and so we deduce that 1 has multiplicity 5 and -2 has multiplicity 4.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-actual-proof">the actual proof</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 2</strong></p> <p>If \(\mathbf{K}_{10}\) represents the adjaceny matrix of the complete graph on 10 vertices, \(\mathbf{J}_{10}\) represents the matrix with all its entries being equal to \(1\) and \(\mathbf{I}_{10}\) represents the identity matrix of size \(10 \times 10\), then</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*}\mathbf{K}_{10} = \mathbf{J}_{10} - \mathbf{I}_{10}\end{align*} $$ </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof:</strong> The adjacency matrix of \(K_{10}\) has all but its diagonal entries being equal to \(1\), since every node in the full graph is connected to every other node except itself. The diagonal entries of \(\mathbf{K}_{10}\) are filled in with \(0\)’s since there is no path from any of the nodes to itself. One can also clearly see that the matrix described by the equation \(\mathbf{J}_{10} - \mathbf{I}_{10}\) is a matrix that has all but its diagonal entries being equal to \(1\) and its diagonal entries being equal to \(0\).</p> <p>Therefore the adjacency matrix of \(\mathbf{K}_{10} = \mathbf{J}_{10} - \mathbf{I}_{10}\)</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Assumption:</strong></p> <p style="overflow-x:auto:"> $$ \begin{align*}\mathbf{A}_P + \mathbf{A}_Q + \mathbf{A}_R = J_{10} - I_{10}\end{align*} $$ </p> </blockquote> <p>We consider three permutation matrices of the Petersen Graph \(A_P, A_Q\) and \(A_R\) (matrices formed by simultaneous row and column swaps in the original adjacency matrix of the petersen graph). We construct each of these permutation matrices such that \(A_Q = CAC^{-1}\) where \(C\) is some matrix. By this construction, \(A_Q\) and \(A\) are similar, and an important consequence is that they have the same eigenvalues. This assumption and construction is true for \(A_P\) and \(A_R\).</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 3</strong></p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \text{Null} (\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}) \subseteq \text{Span} (\mathbf{1})^{\perp} $$ </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof:</strong> We wish to show that \(\mathbf{1}^{\top} = \mathbf{y}^{\top}(\mathbf{A}_P - I_{10})\) for some vector \(\mathbf{y} \in R^{10}\). Consider \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{1}^{\top}\). The matrix product \(\mathbf{1}^{\top}(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10})\) yields the vector whose entries are the sum of the entries of the columns of \(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}\). for an arbitrary column \(i\) in its adjacency matrix, by the way the Petersen graph was defined we know that he graph has 3 outgoing edges which means that the sum of the entries of a column in its adjacency matrix is 3. However note that the diagonal entries of the adjacency matrix will be 0 since the Petersen graph does not contain self-loops. After subtracting the \(i\)th column of \(\mathbf{I}_{10}\), the sum of the columns of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}\) is 2. Note that the identity matrix has 0 in every entry where \(i \neq j\). Since the above holds true for an arbitrary column of the matrix, We can conclude that every column of \(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}\) sums up to a 2. More fundamentally, the product \(\mathbf{1}^{\top}(\mathbf{A}_{P} - \mathbf{I}_{10})\) generates the all twos vector or 2\(\mathbf{1}^{\top}\).</p> <p>Therefore we can assert that \(\text{Span}(\mathbf{1}) \subseteq \text{Row} (\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10})\).</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>side proof</strong></p> <p>Let \(A\) and \(B\) be two subspaces such that \(A \subseteq B\), then</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ B^{\perp} \subseteq A^{\perp} $$ </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong> Let \(\mathbf{x} \in B^{\perp}\).

Therefore it is not possible to cover the full graph or \(K_{10}\) with 3 Petersen graphs.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="key-takeaways">key takeaways</h2> <p>How cool is this!! All we did here was take advantage of some fairly simple linear algebra to prove a really fundamental fact about graphs that pop up quite frequently in the study of networks. For those interested, there is a conjecture in the “colorful” field of graph decomposition by the name of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-ringels-graph-theory-conjecture-20200219/">Ringel’s Conjecture</a> that actually illustrates how exactly you can cover complete graphs of this variety. If there’s anything I want you to take away from this proof, it’s that geometric intution is unparalleled and this technique of analyzing eigenvalues not only can save you computation, it gives you critical insight into what the graph actually represents, a deeper understanding of what it “does”, so to speak. It is so easy to get bogged down in what might just seem like computation after computation. But there is a bigger picture, and that bigger picture is usually a bigger graph.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="higher-dimensions-and-moore-graphs">higher dimensions and moore graphs</h2> <p><strong>degree-diameter problem:</strong> In graph theory, the degree diameter problem is the problem of finding the largest possible graph \(G\) (in terms of the size of its vertex set \(V\)) of diameter \(d\) such that the largest degree of the vertices in \(G\) is at most \(k\). The size of \(G\) is bounded above by the Moore bound; In general, the largest degree-diameter graphs are much smaller than as prescribed by the Moore bound.</p> <p><strong>the moore bound and moore graphs</strong> The moore bound gives us an upper bound on how many nodes a graph can contain with diameter \(d\) and maximum degree \(k\). An intuitive way to recognize what the moore bound actually tells us is how <em>wide</em> a graph can get. Let \(M\) be the moore bound that a graph of the above specifications can meet, we therefore have that</p> \[M = 1 + k \sum_{i = 0}^{d - 1} (k - 1)^i\] <p>Graphs that attain this bound \(M\) are known as Moore graphs.</p> <p><strong>obtaining the moore bound</strong></p> <p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/assets/img/notes.jpg" alt="moore graphs" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"/> </p> <p>Consider the breadth first search of a graph \(G\). From the above picture, we can clearly see that level 0 has only one node, this being the root of the tree generated by breadth first search. Level 1 has at most \(k\) nodes since the maximum degree of any node in the graph is given by \(k\). For each node \(i\) in Level 1, \(i\) can be connected to at most \(k - 1\) nodes (it’s important not to forget the node they are connected to in Level 0). Since there are \(k\) nodes in the first level, the maximum number of nodes in level 2 is given by \(k(k - 1)\).</p> <p>Generalizing, we have that the number of nodes in a level \(j\) \(\leq k(k - 1)^{j - 1}\).</p> <p>Notice that we can count the nodes from level 1 to \(d\) (we can’t have more than \(d\) levels) using a sum given by \(\sum_{i = 1}^{d} k(k - 1)^{i - 1}\). We also have to account for the root node which adds 1 to this total sum formula. After some substitution of variables, we get that the final expression for the upper bound comes out to be</p> \[M = 1 + k \sum_{i = 0}^{d - 1} (k - 1)^{i - 1}\] <p><strong>types of moore graphs and its relation to the petersen graph</strong> The entire reason we’re even talking about moore graphs is that the petersen graph is a very specific kind of moore graph. Remember that equation we found for the adjacency matrix of the petersen graph. Well for the moore graphs that are known to exist, they satisfy the same “general form” of that equation.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 5</strong></p> <p>The only \(d\)-regular Moore graphs of girth 5 and diameter 2 exist for \(d = 2, 3, 7\) and possibly \(57\).</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong> Assume \(G\) is a \(d\)-regular Moore graph of girth 5. A reminder that the girth of a graph is defined to be \(2k + 1\) where \(k\) is the diameter of the graph. Solving the above equation for the girth, we get that the diameter of the graph must be 2, i.e. \(k = 2\). Substituting in this value into the Moore bound, we get that the number of the vertices in the graph is given by</p> \[n = 1 + d + d(d- 1) = d^{2} + 1\] <p>As we did for the petersen graph, we consider the square of the adjacency matrix \(A^{2}\) once again. Notice that the adjacenct vertices don’t share any neighbours since if they did, there would be a triangle in \(G\). Non-adjacent vertices share exactly one neighbor, because the diameter of \(G\) is 2. Hence, \(A^{2}\) has \(d\) on the diagonal, 0 for edges and 1 for non-edges.</p> <p>In other words, we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ (A^{2} + A)_{i, j} = \begin{cases} d &amp; \forall i = j \\ 1 &amp; \forall i \neq j \end{cases} $$ </p> <p>We therefore have that \(\mathbf{A}\) satisfies the equation \(\mathbf{A}^{2} + \mathbf{A} = (d - 1)\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J}\)</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 6</strong></p> <p>If \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) different from \(d\), we get from the above equation that</p> \[\lambda^{2} + \lambda - (d - 1) = 0\] </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong> I suppose I should have talked about this earlier, but the all ones matrix \(\mathbf{J}_d\) has eigenvalues 0 and \(d\), where the eigenvalue \(d\) corresponds to an eigenspace with the all ones vector or \({\bf 1}\).</p> <p>Let \(x\) be the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Multiplying both sides of the equation we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} \mathbf{A}^{2}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{A}x &amp;= (d - 1)\mathbf{x} = 0 \\ \lambda^{2}\mathbf{x} + \lambda \mathbf{x} &amp;= (d - 1)\mathbf{x} \implies \lambda^2 + \lambda - (d - 1) = 0 \end{align*} $$ </p> <p><strong>obtaining the parameters for which moore graphs exist</strong><br/> We can use the quadratic formula to ascertain that the roots of the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) are given by \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). Plugging in constants from the equation above, we have that \(\lambda = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(d - 1)}}{2} = - \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\).</p> <p>Assume that \(\frac{-1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\) has multiplicity \(a\) and \(\frac{-1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\) has multiplicity \(b\). Using the fact that the trace of a matrix \(A\) is the sum of its diagonal entries, we can ascertain that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} d(1) + \left(\frac{-1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\right)a + \left(\frac{-1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\right)b &amp;= 0 \implies d - \frac{a + b}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \; (a - b) \sqrt{4d - 3} = 0 \end{align*}$$ </p> <p>However we know that \(a + b = n - 1\) and from our previous computation of \(n\), we get that \(a + b = d^{2}\). Substituting in, we get that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} d - \frac{d^2}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \; (a - b) \sqrt{4d - 3} &amp;= 0 \implies (a - b) \sqrt{4d - 3} = d^{2} - 2d \end{align*}$$ </p> <p>This statement is only true if \(a = b\) and \(d = 2\) (the trivial case of both sides being 0) or else \(4d - 3\) is a square.</p> <p>Let \(4d - 3 = s^{2}\). Therefore, we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} d - \frac{d^2}{2} + \frac{s}{2} \; (a - b) &amp;= 0 \implies d = \frac{s^{2} + 3}{4} \\ \frac{1}{4} \; (s^{2} + 3) - \frac{1}{2} \; (s^2 + 3)^{2} + \frac{s}{2} \; (2a - \frac{1}{16} \; (s^2 + 3)^{2}) &amp;= 0 &amp;&amp;\text{Substituting in $$d$$} \\ s^{5} + s^{4} + 6s^{3} - 2s^2 + (9 - 32a)s - 15 &amp;= 0 &amp;&amp;\text{After an ungodly amount of math :(} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>To satisfy the above equation, we have that \(s\) must divide 15, i.e. \(s \in \{1, 3, 5, 15 \}\). Since \(s^2 = 4d - 3\), we have that \(d \in \{1, 3, 7, 57 \}\).</p> <p>When \(d = 1\), we get the complete graph on 2 vertices, i.e. \(K_2\) which is not a Moore graph since it doesn’t meet the Moore bound.</p> <p>For all the other cases, we have that</p> <ul> <li>\(d = 2\): \(C_5\)</li> <li>\(d = 3\): Petersen Graph</li> <li>\(d = 7\): Hoffman Singleton Graph</li> <li>\(d = 57\): Open problem if this graph exists :0</li> </ul> <p>There’s a lemma floating around the internet somewhere where it states that Moore graphs don’t exist for diameters greater than 2 which is kind of insane if you think about it.
