This is one of those moments. This might look familiar to some people already but given a quadratic equation \(ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\), the discrimanant \(D_{Q}\) is given by \(b^{2} - 4ac\).

Veteran graph theoreticians will be familiar with this pentagram inscribed within the spokes of a regular pentagon. The Petersen graph is used as a counter example in tons of graph theory proofs which is one of the reasons it’s so well studied, partly what we’ll be doing here. The Petersen graph has $10$ nodes and $15$ edges, and is what we call $3$-regular.</p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> A graph is said to be $d$-regular iff every vertex has the same degree $d$. (i.e. it is strongly regular)</p> <p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/assets/img/full.png" alt="complete graph" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"/> </p> <p>This is the complete graph on $10$ vertices. For the sake of convenience, we will refer to this graph as $K_{10}$. It has $10$ nodes and $45$ edges (i.e., all possible edges among $10$ nodes). If we follow along from the same scheme of defining things, the number of edges in $K_{n}$ (the complete graph with $n$ vertices) is given by $\binom{n}{2}$.</p> <p>In this proof, $\mathbf{J}_{n}$ refers to the all ones matrix with dimension/size $n \times n$.</p> <p>The row space of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is defined as follows, $\text{Row}(A) = \{\mathbf{y}^{\mathbf{\top}} A : \mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}\}$</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>definition</strong></p> \[\textsf{Trace}(\mathbf{A}) = \sum \limits_{x \in E_{x}(\mathbf{A})}^{} \lambda_{x}\] </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 1</strong></p> <p>For a symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$, eigenvectors corresponding to <em>distinct</em> eigenvalues are orthogonal</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong><br/> Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be eigenvectors of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ corresponding to eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ respectively. Therefore we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ \begin{align*} \mathbf{y}^{\top} \mathbf{Ax} = \mathbf{y}^{\top} \lambda_1 \mathbf{x} &amp;\implies \mathbf{y}^{\top} \mathbf{A}^\top \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{y}^{\top} \lambda_1 \mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\implies \mathbf{(Ay)}^{\top} \mathbf{x} = \lambda_1 \mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\implies (\lambda_2 \mathbf{y})^\top \mathbf{x} = \lambda_2 \mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} \\ &amp;\implies \mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} (\lambda_2 - \lambda_1) = 0 \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>However, we already know that $\lambda_2 \neq \lambda_1$. Therefore $\lambda_2 - \lambda_1 \neq 0$, and it must be the case that $\mathbf{y}^{\top}\mathbf{x} = 0$.</p> <p>Therefore $x$ and $y$ are orthogonal.</p> <p><strong>adjacency matrices:</strong></p> <blockquote> <p><strong>definition</strong></p> <p>We define the adjacency matrix of a graph $G = (V, E)$ as the following,</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ A_{ij} = \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{there is an edge from} \; j \; \text{to} \; i\\0 &amp; \text{there is no edge from} \; j \; \text{to} \; i\\ \end{cases} $$ </p> </blockquote> <p>Since we’re dealing with an undirected graph in this proof, every edge $(a, b)$ is counted as the same edge as if there were an edge $(b, a)$ in the graph. As a consequence, the adjacency matrices for this family of graphs will be symmetric.</p> <p>The way to think about it is that the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$ encodes information about the number of length $1$ paths between any pair of vertices $i$ and $j$, i.e. information about the vertices immediately “adjacent” to each other.</p> <h3 id="motivation">motivation:</h3> <p>Each node in $K_{10}$ has $9$ edges incident to it while each node in the Petersen graph has $3$ edges incident to it. So it is plausible that $K_{10}$ can be covered perfectly by $3$ Petersen graphs. This means that you can lay down three Petersens on $K_{10}$ so that vertices go to vertices and each edge of $K_{10}$ lies under an edge of exactly one of the three Petersens. This hints at some pretty cutting-edge stuff in the field of graph decomposition and graph coloring and the parallels in higher dimensions is absolutely incredible. With some linear algebra at our disposal, we will show that it is not possible to completely cover $K_{10}$ with three Petersen graphs.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="eigenvalues-of-the-petersen-graph">eigenvalues of the petersen graph</h2> <p>Finding the eigenvalues of any matrix, let alone one that of size $10 \times 10$ is a fairly computational task and isn’t enlightening in any form whatsoever. So why are we trying to find the eigenvalues of the petersen graph? Well we can take advantage of the fact that the adjacency matrix represents information that carries physical meaning (vertex-edge relations of a graph) and can use the language of linear transformations and some geometric intuition to gain insight into the eigenvalues of this graph.</p> <p>Let $\mathbf{A}$ be the adjacency matrix of the Petersen Graph. If $\mathbf{A}$ encodes information about the number of length $1$, $\mathbf{A}^2$ represents information about the number of length $2$ paths, and in general, $A^k$ encodes information about the number of $k$-length paths in a given graph. With this information in our belt, we know can make a pretty nifty observation.</p> <p>Consider the $i, j^{th}$ entry of the matrix $\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A}$ (the sum of the matrices representing information about the number of length $2$ paths and the regular adjacency matrix of the petersen graph). Since, every vertex in the petersen graph has degree $3$, each vertex has $3$ length $2$ paths back itself whereas there are no length $1$ paths from a vertex to itself. With this information under our belt, we can say that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ (A^2 + A)_{ij} = \begin{cases} 3 &amp; \forall i = j \\ 1 &amp; \forall i \neq j \end{cases} $$ </p> <p>This follows from noticing that any pair of vertices not already joined by an edge are joined by a unique path of length $2$; namely there is a unique vertex which is joined to both.</p> <p>We can therefore conclude that the matrix $\mathbf{}$ satisfies the matrix equation $\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A} = 2\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J}$</p> <p>Note that $\mathbf{J}$ has eigenvalue 10 (of multiplicity 1 with eigenvector 1) and eigenvalue 0 of multiplicity 9. Thus $2\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J}$ has eigenvalue 12 of multiplicity 1 and eigenvalue 2 of multiplicity 9. Now if $x$ is an eigenvector of A of eigenvalue $\lambda$ then $\mathbf{x}$ is an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}^2 + \mathbf{A}$ of eigenvalue $\lambda^2 + \lambda$.</p> <p>Thus the possible eigenvectors for $\mathbf{A}$ are prescribed. We already know that $\mathbf{1}$ is an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$ of eigenvalue 3 (or at least it is easy to check). The other 9 eigenvalues must satisfy $\lambda^2 + \lambda = 2$ thus either 1 or -2 with total multiplicity being 9. Now the trace of $\mathbf{A}$, which is 0, is the sum of the eigenvalues and so we deduce that 1 has multiplicity 5 and -2 has multiplicity 4.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-actual-proof">the actual proof</h2> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 2</strong></p> <p>If \(\mathbf{K}_{10}\) represents the adjaceny matrix of the complete graph on 10 vertices, \(\mathbf{J}_{10}\) represents the matrix with all its entries being equal to \(1\) and \(\mathbf{I}_{10}\) represents the identity matrix of size \(10 \times 10\), then</p> \[\mathbf{K}_{10} = \mathbf{J}_{10} - \mathbf{I}_{10}\] </blockquote> <p><strong>proof:</strong> The adjacency matrix of \(K_{10}\) has all but its diagonal entries being equal to $1$, since every node in the full graph is connected to every other node except itself. The diagonal entries of \(\mathbf{K}_{10}\) are filled in with $0$’s since there is no path from any of the nodes to itself. One can also clearly see that the matrix described by the equation \(\mathbf{J}_{10} - \mathbf{I}_{10}\) is a matrix that has all but its diagonal entries being equal to $1$ and its diagonal entries being equal to $0$.</p> <p>Therefore the adjacency matrix of \(\mathbf{K}_{10} = \mathbf{J}_{10} - \mathbf{I}_{10}\)</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Assumption:</strong></p> \[\mathbf{A}_P + \mathbf{A}_Q + \mathbf{A}_R = J_{10} - I_{10}\] <p>We consider three permutation matrices of the Petersen Graph $A_P, A_Q$ and $A_R$ (matrices formed by simultaneous row and column swaps in the original adjacency matrix of the petersen graph). We construct each of these permutation matrices such that $A_Q = CAC^{-1}$ where $C$ is some matrix. By this construction, $A_Q$ and $A$ are similar, and an important consequence is that they have the same eigenvalues. This assumption and construction is true for $A_P$ and $A_R$.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 3</strong></p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\text{Null} (\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}) \subseteq \text{Span} (\mathbf{1})^{\perp}$$</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof:</strong> We wish to show that \(\mathbf{1}^{\top} = \mathbf{y}^{\top}(\mathbf{A}_P - I_{10})\) for some vector \(\mathbf{y} \in R^{10}\). Consider \(\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{1}^{\top}\). The matrix product \(\mathbf{1}^{\top}(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10})\) yields the vector whose entries are the sum of the entries of the columns of \(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}\). for an arbitrary column \(i\) in its adjacency matrix, by the way the Petersen graph was defined we know that he graph has 3 outgoing edges which means that the sum of the entries of a column in its adjacency matrix is 3. However note that the diagonal entries of the adjacency matrix will be 0 since the Petersen graph does not contain self-loops. After subtracting the \(i\)th column of \(\mathbf{I}_{10}\), the sum of the columns of the matrix \(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}\) is 2. Note that the identity matrix has 0 in every entry where \(i \neq j\). Since the above holds true for an arbitrary column of the matrix, We can conclude that every column of \(\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10}\) sums up to a 2. More fundamentally, the product \(\mathbf{1}^{\top}(\mathbf{A}_{P} - \mathbf{I}_{10})\) generates the all twos vector or 2$\mathbf{1}^{\top}$.</p> <p>Therefore we can assert that \(\text{Span}(\mathbf{1}) \subseteq \text{Row} (\mathbf{A}_P - \mathbf{I}_{10})\).</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>side proof</strong></p> <p>Let $A$ and $B$ be two subspaces such that $A \subseteq B$, then</p> \[B^{\perp} \subseteq A^{\perp}\] </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong> Let $\mathbf{x} \in B^{\perp}$. By definition of the orthogonal complement, we have that $\forall \mathbf{v} \in B, \mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{v} = 0$. However we know that any vector contained in $B$ will be a vector contained in $A$, ($A$ is a subset of the vectors contained in $B$). Therefore $\mathbf{x}$ is orthogonal to every vector in $A$.

In the beginning of the proof, we found all the eigenvalues of the Petersen Graph and concluded that -3 was not amongst that list. However as we can see, we have proved that -3 in fact is an eigenvalue for the adjacency matrix of a Petersen graph. Therefore it is not possible to cover the full graph or $K_{10}$ with 3 Petersen graphs.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="key-takeaways">key takeaways</h2> <p>How cool is this!! All we did here was take advantage of some fairly simple linear algebra to prove a really fundamental fact about graphs that pop up quite frequently in the study of networks. For those interested, there is a conjecture in the “colorful” field of graph decomposition by the name of <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-prove-ringels-graph-theory-conjecture-20200219/">Ringel’s Conjecture</a> that actually illustrates how exactly you can cover complete graphs of this variety. If there’s anything I want you to take away from this proof, it’s that geometric intution is unparalleled and this technique of analyzing eigenvalues not only can save you computation, it gives you critical insight into what the graph actually represents, a deeper understanding of what it “does”, so to speak. It is so easy to get bogged down in what might just seem like computation after computation. But there is a bigger picture, and that bigger picture is usually a bigger graph.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="higher-dimensions-and-moore-graphs">higher dimensions and moore graphs</h2> <p><strong>degree-diameter problem:</strong> In graph theory, the degree diameter problem is the problem of finding the largest possible graph $G$ (in terms of the size of its vertex set $V$) of diameter $d$ such that the largest degree of the vertices in $G$ is at most $k$. The size of $G$ is bounded above by the Moore bound; In general, the largest degree-diameter graphs are much smaller than as prescribed by the Moore bound.</p> <p><strong>the moore bound and moore graphs</strong> The moore bound gives us an upper bound on how many nodes a graph can contain with diameter $d$ and maximum degree $k$. An intuitive way to recognize what the moore bound actually tells us is how <em>wide</em> a graph can get. Let $M$ be the moore bound that a graph of the above specifications can meet, we therefore have that</p> \[M = 1 + k \sum_{i = 0}^{d - 1} (k - 1)^i\] <p>Graphs that attain this bound $M$ are known as Moore graphs.</p> <p><strong>obtaining the moore bound</strong></p> <p style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/assets/img/notes.jpg" alt="moore graphs" style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"/> </p> <p>Consider the breadth first search of a graph $G$. From the above picture, we can clearly see that level 0 has only one node, this being the root of the tree generated by breadth first search. Level 1 has at most $k$ nodes since the maximum degree of any node in the graph is given by $k$. For each node $i$ in Level 1, $i$ can be connected to at most $k - 1$ nodes (it’s important not to forget the node they are connected to in Level 0). Since there are $k$ nodes in the first level, the maximum number of nodes in level 2 is given by $k(k - 1)$.</p> <p>Generalizing, we have that the number of nodes in a level $j$ $\leq k(k - 1)^{j - 1}$.</p> <p>Notice that we can count the nodes from level 1 to $d$ (we can’t have more than $d$ levels) using a sum given by $\sum_{i = 1}^{d} k(k - 1)^{i - 1}$. We also have to account for the root node which adds 1 to this total sum formula. After some substitution of variables, we get that the final expression for the upper bound comes out to be</p> \[M = 1 + k \sum_{i = 0}^{d - 1} (k - 1)^{i - 1}\] <p><strong>types of moore graphs and its relation to the petersen graph</strong> The entire reason we’re even talking about moore graphs is that the petersen graph is a very specific kind of moore graph. Remember that equation we found for the adjacency matrix of the petersen graph. Well for the moore graphs that are known to exist, they satisfy the same “general form” of that equation.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 5</strong></p> <p>The only $d$-regular Moore graphs of girth 5 and diameter 2 exist for $d = 2, 3, 7$ and possibly $57$.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong> Assume $G$ is a $d$-regular Moore graph of girth 5. A reminder that the girth of a graph is defined to be $2k + 1$ where $k$ is the diameter of the graph. Solving the above equation for the girth, we get that the diameter of the graph must be 2, i.e. $k = 2$. Substituting in this value into the Moore bound, we get that the number of the vertices in the graph is given by</p> \[n = 1 + d + d(d- 1) = d^{2} + 1\] <p>As we did for the petersen graph, we consider the square of the adjacency matrix $A^{2}$ once again. Notice that the adjacenct vertices don’t share any neighbours since if they did, there would be a triangle in $G$. Non-adjacent vertices share exactly one neighbor, because the diameter of $G$ is 2. Hence, $A^{2}$ has $d$ on the diagonal, 0 for edges and 1 for non-edges.</p> <p>In other words, we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$ (A^{2} + A)_{i, j} = \begin{cases} d &amp; \forall i = j \\ 1 &amp; \forall i \neq j \end{cases} $$ </p> <p>We therefore have that \(\mathbf{A}\) satisfies the equation $ \mathbf{A}^{2} + \mathbf{A} = (d - 1)\mathbf{I} + \mathbf{J} $</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>lemma 6</strong></p> <p>If $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $A$ different from $d$, we get from the above equation that</p> \[\lambda^{2} + \lambda - (d - 1) = 0\] </blockquote> <p><strong>proof</strong> I suppose I should have talked about this earlier, but the all ones matrix \(\mathbf{J}_d\) has eigenvalues 0 and $d$, where the eigenvalue $d$ corresponds to an eigenspace with the all ones vector or ${\bf 1}$.</p> <p>Let $x$ be the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Multiplying both sides of the equation we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} \mathbf{A}^{2}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{A}x &amp;= (d - 1)\mathbf{x} = 0 \\ \lambda^{2}\mathbf{x} + \lambda \mathbf{x} &amp;= (d - 1)\mathbf{x} \implies \lambda^2 + \lambda - (d - 1) = 0 \end{align*} $$ </p> <p><strong>obtaining the parameters for which moore graphs exist</strong><br/> We can use the quadratic formula to ascertain that the roots of the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$. Plugging in constants from the equation above, we have that $\lambda = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4(d - 1)}}{2} = - \frac{1}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}$.</p> <p>Assume that $\frac{-1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}$ has multiplicity $a$ and $\frac{-1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}$ has multiplicity $b$. Using the fact that the trace of a matrix $A$ is the sum of its diagonal entries, we can ascertain that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} d(1) + \left(\frac{-1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\right)a + \left(\frac{-1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{4d - 3}}{2}\right)b &amp;= 0 \implies d - \frac{a + b}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \; (a - b) \sqrt{4d - 3} = 0 \end{align*}$$ </p> <p>However we know that $a + b = n - 1$ and from our previous computation of $n$, we get that $a + b = d^{2}$. Substituting in, we get that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} d - \frac{d^2}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \; (a - b) \sqrt{4d - 3} &amp;= 0 \implies (a - b) \sqrt{4d - 3} = d^{2} - 2d \end{align*}$$ </p> <p>This statement is only true if $a = b$ and $d = 2$ (the trivial case of both sides being 0) or else $4d - 3$ is a square.</p> <p>Let $4d - 3 = s^{2}$. Therefore, we have that</p> <p style="overflow-x:auto"> $$\begin{align*} d - \frac{d^2}{2} + \frac{s}{2} \; (a - b) &amp;= 0 \implies d = \frac{s^{2} + 3}{4} \\ \frac{1}{4} \; (s^{2} + 3) - \frac{1}{2} \; (s^2 + 3)^{2} + \frac{s}{2} \; (2a - \frac{1}{16} \; (s^2 + 3)^{2}) &amp;= 0 &amp;&amp;\text{Substituting in $d$} \\ s^{5} + s^{4} + 6s^{3} - 2s^2 + (9 - 32a)s - 15 &amp;= 0 &amp;&amp;\text{After an ungodly amount of math :(} \end{align*} $$ </p> <p>To satisfy the above equation, we have that $s$ must divide 15, i.e. $s \in {1, 3, 5, 15 }$. Since $s^2 = 4d - 3$, we have that $d \in {1, 3, 7, 57 }$.</p> <p>When $d = 1$, we get the complete graph on 2 vertices, i.e. $K_2$ which is not a Moore graph since it doesn’t meet the Moore bound.</p> <p>For all the other cases, we have that</p> <ul> <li>$d = 2$: $C_5$</li> <li>$d = 3$: Petersen Graph</li> <li>$d = 7$: Hoffman Singleton Graph</li> <li>$d = 57$: Open problem if this graph exists :0</li> </ul> <p>There’s a lemma floating around the internet somewhere where it states that Moore graphs don’t exist for diameters greater than 2 which is kind of insane if you think about it.

In fact, what I’m saying is the complete opposite. I suppose picking up on subtlety is often times hard when one is filled with illusions of grandeur. In fact, this is something that is quite personal for me. In some strange way, despite my social anxiety and my desire for conscientuousness, I’ve often time craved the attention of those I’m close with in more ways than one.</p> <p>Everyone desires love, in fact I’d go so far as to say, that there is no other reason we continue to dredge on with what sometimes feels like a “meaningless existence”. That might be a loaded statement, but I think there’s at least a modicum of truth to my words here. It’s so incredibly easy to get attach your idea of self worth to the opinions of others, and to some extent, I’d argue that that’s a good thing! It drives us to be better, to do better, to be more than what we are right now, to be more than what we were yesterday. Like all things in life however, there is a fine line between being driven by the opinions of others and letting the opinions of others drive you.</p> <p>Balance is hard! I’m not going to sit here and pretend like I have it all figured out. Despite a newfound self awareness on my part, I still grapple with the same issues I’ve had for the past few years. The same insecurities, the same doubts, the same fears. Most nights, I ask myself if I’m doing enough for the people I care about, if I’m doing enough for myself, if I’m proud of the person I’ve become. Facing up to the kind of person you really are, flaws and all is a difficult thing to do. It’s easy to hide behind a facade, the character you’ve created for yourself, the person you wish you were. The allure of the perfect avatar is powerful, and while self deception releases dopamine like nothing else, it’s short-lived, and the crash that follows is often times worse than the high. You won’t feel shitty about yourself in the conventional sense, but you’ll lose a part of your identity, a much more insidious fate if you ask me.</p> <p>So, what does this off-tangent tirade have to do with the title of this post? Well, I think the reason we’re as concerned as we are with the opinion of others is because we’re trying to play a central part in their lives. I don’t know if I’m speaking for everybody here, but this has at least been somewhat true for me. I’d like to think that I’m naturally an empathetic person, but sometimes I’ve found that my desire for helping others out trumps what they’re asking for in the first place. It’s not your job to fix everyone’s problems, and while this is not to say you shouldn’t help out when you can, it’s to say that the most important things in these types of situations is to listen, and give people the space to figure things out for themselves.</p> <p>So say it with me folks; you’re not the main character in everyone’s story. In fact it’s almost unereasonable to think that you are. The world is a big place, and there are a lot of people in it. Behind every single one of them is a story, a story that is just as important as yours, a culture just as rich. There is something so incredibly powerful about letting other people take the reigns of their own lives. There is something masculine, something feminine, and if you happen to identify with gender identities that are outside the conventional dichotomy, there is something humane about being an observer to the lives of others. Everyone wants to help the world. Start instead with helping a single person in it. I promise you, that the rest will follow and while you may not be the protagonist in everyone’s story, you are the narrator of your own. I don’t know about you, but I think that’s something worth celebrating.</p> <p>~Lukshya</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essays"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[liberating yourself from the shackles of self importance]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">my take on much of modern philosophy</title><link href="https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/phil/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="my take on much of modern philosophy"/><published>2023-12-12T22:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-12T22:25:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/phil</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/phil/"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things that has constantly befuddled me, is how the decision-making process works in our brain. How exactly is the ability to discern between right and wrong developed? How does our brain know what’s right and what’s wrong? And if I’m right we’re probably just slaves to an evolutionary trait.</p> <p>Don your monocle, suit yourself up with the most expensive Prada you can find and arm yourself with a smug expression that would make your ancestors proud. We’re going to pretentious land, and this time we’re going in deep.</p> <p>Free will is perhaps one of the most complicated areas of research in modern psychology, and I am but an uneducated swine. I do not have a degree in psychology nor do I have any qualifications in philosophy, so a fair warning: take my words with a grain of salt.</p> <p>Charles Darwin was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist, and in addition to having some of the most kick-ass verses in ERB’s matchup against Ash Ketchum, he was responsible for propounding the “Theory of Natural Selection”, which explains how genetic traits change over time relative to habitat and environment.</p> <p>Some of you may know where I’m going with this, in essence, if the development of our brain is a genetic trait, then well the argument ends there: we’re at the mercy of the environment, both physically and mentally.</p> <p>But it’s interesting to note, that people now aren’t any more intelligent than they were before, the standard model of the distribution of people concerning their Intelligence Quotient has remained the same with slight changes here and there. It was a bell curve and continues to remain so. While IQ is an imperfect metric for measuring intelligence, it is the only one we possess and serves a purpose for some form of evidence to the point I’m trying to make.</p> <p>People aren’t any smarter than they were before, but the psyche behind making decisions has definitely evolved concerning changing time and circumstances. So do we chart the former to natural selection and the other to be a clandestine constant? Well, we could, but it’s fascinating that these two deeply intertwined processes have completely different origins and paths followed.</p> <p>Intelligence is a whole another issue, one I haven’t thought enough about, and I am in no position to speak about. Perhaps, however, the psyche behind discerning right and wrong, the question I raised at the beginning of the passage, is more interesting to think about.</p> <p>If what I’ve said is true and the ability to distinguish between what is black and what is white is a genetic trait, then that’s a whole new curveball to our existence. Everything we’ve ever done, all the opinions we’ve forged, the discussions we’ve had, everything is just a result of adaption.</p> <p>Survival and sustenance, perhaps the only reasons why people have different opinions. Our morality is forged from circumstance, and our circumstance is forged primarily from geographical barriers and socio-political constraints borne as a result of that primary binding. The reason why everyone has a different perspective on life, or different opinions on issues affecting us, is all a result of their fragmented understanding of how best to survive: establishing a connection with humans. We were a social animal, we will continue to remain so.</p> <p>Strength has an odd role to play in this, but it ties into the whole scope of how some people are non-confrontational or some people are malleable in their opinion, while some are as stubborn as the mule that assisted Shrek on his journey. It’s all essentially a by-product of establishing a connection with other human beings, who ironically are doing the very same.</p> <p>Perhaps that’s enough for today. If we do indeed have no free will, I’m not really worried. The same force has led to us making memes and sub-1-minute youtube clips from 2010 which are in every sense the most hysterical things I’ve ever seen.</p> <p>For now, farewell and if ever in doubt, there’s always the lad on YouTube who thought he was a bush.</p> <p>~Lukshya</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essays"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[a pretentious look at free will where i say a lot of nothing]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">ptsd is wild, man</title><link href="https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/ptsd/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ptsd is wild, man"/><published>2023-07-12T13:56:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-12T13:56:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/ptsd</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/ptsd/"><![CDATA[<p>Cinders ricochet off pale hands, forged in treacherous flames. The heat was unbearable, but his hands faltered for not a second. Twas the fear of the cold , an approach in stillness akin to that of death itself. He was a survivor, one whom life had tested rather redundantly it seemed.</p> <p>The outcome was always unary, a young boy emerging the victor, through sacrifice and toil. The night passed with the brightest of rays shining though the worn down apartment. A bold heart told him of his days of yore, those of naivety and childlike innocence. Experience was a stark reminder of this futility of thoughts.</p> <p>He made his way over to the broken down sink and with the left over rations of food packets and half empty bottle of cranberry juice he headed over to the kitchen table. He sat over the battered table eating his morning meal, pondering over the agenda for his day. On the sight of the bloodied red pulp of his morning drink he was transported to a place he’s grown all too familiar to visiting.</p> <p>He found himself in the Verdana running, away from what, he dared not imagine. His superior was shot down and his comrades were long gone. The remains of his Kevlar hid the bruise on the centre of his chest. Pain was an old friend, and so he soldiered on through the swirling mess of a battlefield.</p> <p>He was back in the apartment, thankful that he had not gone away for a long time. He headed over to the grocery store for refilling the now low supply of food and daily provisions in his residence. Every begrudging step he took across the inlaid marble floor of the market, was a subtle reminder of the crucial steps “both literal and metaphorical” he took in his younger days, the smiles of people with their loved ones a dreary reminder of what he had lost.</p> <p>She was his guiding light. A passionate young woman of about the same age who would stop at nothing to get conscripted into the army. They had met in his early days of academy training and the moment he set eyes on her, he knew that she would be the one to temper his soul. It was in those days when he was at his happiest. The days leading up to meeting her, the cheerful time spent with her training, fighting over the last bit of blue cheese and arguments over the smallest of things.</p> <p>He cherished it all and found in her family despite being a 1000 miles away from its biological counterpart. Of all of her quirks he remembered one of them most clearly, she had a mild obsession with cranberry juice,something about the tornadoing sight of a red fluid calmed her down. He planned to tie the knot with her after they as comrades would return from that faithful mission of the Verdana. Fate as you would have it did not go as planned.</p> <p>He made his way back to the apartment. It was growing dark now, and it was time to burn once again. This was his curse. Hopeful by day, shattered by night. A continued and confounding sense of domineering dread ruled over his life. The unified sense of struggle of millions across the world offered no alleviation either for he had endured it all; at the cost of his joy.</p> <p>~Lukshya</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="essays"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[need i say any more?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">shadows</title><link href="https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/shadows/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="shadows"/><published>2023-07-04T12:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-04T12:57:00+00:00</updated><id>https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/shadows</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://lukshyaganjoo.github.io/blog/2023/shadows/"><![CDATA[<p>A crippling fear of what lies beyond<br/> Prevalence in terror and knowledge<br/> Yet, a complete lack of direction on the subsequent step<br/> Unexpected, yet moulded in a surprising rigidity</p> <p>Several, fall victim rather recurringly<br/> I must speak my mind before it claims my soul<br/> A herculean task, yet my duty as a human being<br/> All attempts, bound to result in failure<br/> Redefining “helplessness” to something unknown</p> <p>A bead of sweat blurs the nib<br/> An unusual shine to scrawled words on the paper<br/> Words rendered illegible, yet a resounding growl<br/> The cursive, stops mid-way, akin to a paralysed corpse</p> <p>Strange, perhaps due to newfangled disposition<br/> Or just a naivety to unconnected circumstances<br/> I welcome the unpredictable, a strange balm<br/> Yet, there’s something unsettling<br/> Despite a near-needled narcissism<br/> I must question this dissonance in opinion</p> <p>Silly me, I seem to have dropped something<br/> Perchance, a mere triviality; just the ramblings of a madman</p> <p>~Lukshya</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="poetry"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[one of my more creative pieces of writing]]></summary></entry></feed>
